		<center> <h1> The Raven </h1> </center>

		<center> <p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
		<br />By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
		<br />“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,
		<br />Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
		<br />Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”
            	<br /> Quoth the Raven 
		<br /> <marquee style="color:#D3D3D3;background-color:#000000;"> “Nevermore.” </marquee>

  		<center> <p> Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
		<br /> Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
    		<br /> For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
    		<br /> Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
		<br /> Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
            	<br /> With such name as “<i>Nevermore</i>.”

  		<center> <p> But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
		<br /> That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
    		<br />Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
   		<br /> Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—
		<br /> On the morrow <i> he </i> will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”
            	<br /> Then the bird said 
		<br /> <marquee style="color:#D3D3D3;background-color:#000000;"> “Nevermore.” </marquee>

  		<center> <p> Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
		<br /> “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store
    		<br /> Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
    		<br /> Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
		<br /> Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
            	<br /> Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”

  		<center> <p> But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,
		<br /> Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
    		<br />Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
    		<br /> Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
		<br /> What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
            	<br /> Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”

  		<center> <p> This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
		<br /> To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;
    		<br /> This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
    		<br /> On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,
		<br /> But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,
            	<br /> <i> She </i> shall press, ah, nevermore!

  		<center> <p> Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
		<br />Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
   		<br /> “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
    		<br />Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
		<br />Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”
            	<br />Quoth the Raven 
		<br /> <marquee style="color:#D3D3D3;background-color:#000000;"> “Nevermore.” </marquee>

  		<center> <p> “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
		<br />Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
    		<br />Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
   		<br /> On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
		<br /> Is there—<i> is </i> there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”
            	<br /> Quoth the Raven 
		<br /> <marquee style="color:#D3D3D3;background-color:#000000;"> “Nevermore.” </marquee>

   		<center> <p> “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
		<br /> By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
    		<br />Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
    		<br /> It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
		<br /> Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
           	 <br /> Quoth the Raven 
		<br /> <marquee style="color:#D3D3D3;background-color:#000000;"> “Nevermore.” </marquee>

    		<center> <p> “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—
		<br /> “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!
    		<br />Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
    		<br /> Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
		<br /> Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”
            	<br /> Quoth the Raven 
		<br /> <marquee style="color:#D3D3D3;background-color:#000000;"> “Nevermore.” </marquee>

    		<center> <p> And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, <i> still </i> is sitting
		<br /> On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
    		<br /> And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,
    		<br /> And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
		<br /> And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
            	<br /> Shall be lifted— 
		<h2 style="color:#FF0000;"> NEVERMORE! </h2> </center>
